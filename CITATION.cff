abstract: >
  A comprehensive, educational implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 
  techniques applied to AI/ML security applications. This project demonstrates how to build
  a production-ready RAG system for security operations, progressing from basic concepts 
  to advanced techniques like RAPTOR (hierarchical knowledge organization) and ColBERT 
  (late interaction retrieval). Includes 11 detailed Jupyter notebooks covering fundamental 
  RAG concepts, advanced retrieval methods, query decomposition, metadata filtering, 
  intelligent reranking, security hardening (adversarial detection, PII redaction), 
  comprehensive evaluation metrics, and production deployment with Streamlit. The system
  uses authoritative security data sources including MITRE ATT&CK, OWASP Top 10 for LLMs,
  and CVE databases to help security analysts navigate complex frameworks and respond to
  threats more effectively.
