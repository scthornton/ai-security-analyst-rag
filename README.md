## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- OpenAI API key
- (Optional) Cohere API key for re-ranking
- (Optional) LangSmith account for tracing

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd security-rag-from-scratch
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Create a .env file with your API keys
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env
echo "COHERE_API_KEY=your-key-here" >> .env
echo "LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your-key-here" >> .env
echo "LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true" >> .env
```

4. Start with Part 1:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/part_01_introduction.ipynb
```

## Notebooks

Each notebook is self-contained and builds upon previous concepts:

1. **Introduction & Use Case** - Understanding the security analyst assistant use case and architecture overview
2. **Basic RAG** - Implementing fundamental RAG with MITRE ATT&CK and OWASP data
3. **Advanced Retrieval** - Multi-query and RAG-fusion for comprehensive results
4. **Query Decomposition** - Breaking complex security questions into manageable sub-questions
5. **Metadata Filtering** - Structured queries for CVE severity, dates, and affected systems
6. **Intelligent Ranking** - Re-ranking by security priority using Cohere and custom logic
7. **RAPTOR** - Hierarchical security knowledge organization (Tactics → Techniques → Procedures)
8. **ColBERT** - Late interaction retrieval for precise matching of vulnerability patterns
9. **Security Hardening** - Making the RAG system itself secure against adversarial queries
10. **Evaluation & Metrics** - Measuring retrieval quality and generation performance
11. **Deployment** - Building and deploying a working Streamlit application

## Security Data Sources

This project uses authoritative security data sources:

- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** - Adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures
- **OWASP Top 10 for LLMs** - LLM-specific vulnerabilities and mitigations
- **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)** - CVE records with CVSS scores
- **Security Research Papers** - Academic research on adversarial ML and defenses

## Use Cases Demonstrated

- 🔍 Threat intelligence lookup and analysis
- 🛡️ Vulnerability assessment guidance
- 📊 Security framework navigation (MITRE ATT&CK, OWASP)
- 🚨 Incident response recommendations
- 📝 Security policy question answering
- 🔬 Research paper summarization

## Advanced Techniques

### RAPTOR (Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval)
Organizes security knowledge hierarchically, enabling both high-level overviews and detailed specifics.

**Use Case**: Navigate MITRE ATT&CK from tactics down to specific procedures, or OWASP categories to specific vulnerability examples.

### ColBERT (Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT)
Token-level embeddings with late interaction scoring for precise matching.

**Use Case**: Find similar code vulnerability patterns, match exploit signatures, search security logs with complex queries.
