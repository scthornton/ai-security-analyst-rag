# Security Policy

## Purpose

This project is an **educational demonstration** of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques applied to AI/ML security. It is designed for learning, portfolio presentation, and research purposes.

## Scope

### What This Project Is
- ✅ Educational implementation of RAG techniques
- ✅ Defensive security tool demonstration
- ✅ Reference implementation for security analysts
- ✅ Portfolio project showcasing ML security knowledge

### What This Project Is NOT
- ❌ Production-ready security tool (without additional hardening)
- ❌ Offensive security toolkit
- ❌ Certified vulnerability scanner
- ❌ Replacement for professional security tools

## Supported Versions

As an educational project, only the latest version on the `main` branch is maintained.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest (main branch) | :white_check_mark: |
| older commits | :x: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow responsible disclosure:

### For Critical Issues
Contact the maintainer directly at **[your-email]** with:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if applicable)

Please allow up to **48 hours** for initial response.

### For Non-Critical Issues
Open a GitHub issue with:
- Clear description of the security concern
- Affected component (notebook, app, dependency)
- Reproduction steps
- Suggested mitigation

## Security Considerations for Users

### API Keys and Secrets
- **NEVER** commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or `.env` files (excluded in `.gitignore`)
- Rotate API keys if accidentally exposed
- Use read-only or restricted API keys when possible

### Data Privacy
- This project processes security data (CVEs, vulnerability descriptions)
- **Do not** input proprietary or confidential information
- **Do not** use with sensitive organizational data without review
- Be aware of data sent to third-party APIs (OpenAI, Cohere)

### Third-Party Dependencies
This project uses several third-party libraries. Security considerations:
- LangChain, OpenAI, Cohere APIs send data externally
- Vector databases (Chroma) store embeddings locally
- Dependencies are pinned in `requirements.txt` for reproducibility
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches

### Adversarial Testing
Part 9 demonstrates adversarial query detection, but:
- Defenses shown are **educational examples**, not production-grade
- Determined attackers may bypass detection
- Do not rely on this for protecting sensitive systems
- Always implement defense-in-depth

### LLM-Specific Risks
This project uses Large Language Models (LLMs):
- **Prompt Injection**: Demonstrated in Part 9, but defenses may not catch all attempts
- **Data Leakage**: LLMs may inadvertently reveal training data
- **Hallucination**: Generated answers may contain errors despite RAG grounding
- **Bias**: Security recommendations may reflect biases in training data

## Deployment Security

### Local Development
- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies
- Keep API keys in `.env` files (not committed)
- Run on trusted networks only
- Review all dependencies before installation

### Production Deployment (If Adapted)
If you adapt this project for production use, implement additional hardening:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Add user authentication
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Rate limit API requests

2. **Input Validation**
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Implement strict input length limits
   - Add content filtering

3. **Output Filtering**
   - Validate generated responses
   - Redact sensitive information
   - Implement output length limits

4. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Log all queries and responses
   - Monitor for abuse patterns
   - Set up alerting for anomalies

5. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
   - Secure vector database access
   - Implement network segmentation
   - Regular security audits

6. **Dependency Management**
   - Use dependency scanning tools (Snyk, Dependabot)
   - Regularly update all dependencies
   - Monitor for CVEs in dependencies

## Known Limitations

This is an educational project with known limitations:

1. **Adversarial Robustness**: Defenses in Part 9 are examples, not comprehensive protection
2. **PII Detection**: Pattern-based PII redaction may miss variants
3. **Source Verification**: Whitelist approach requires manual curation
4. **Scalability**: Not optimized for high-concurrency production use
5. **Cost**: No rate limiting or cost controls on API usage
6. **Accuracy**: LLM responses may contain errors despite retrieval grounding

## Security Best Practices Demonstrated

This project demonstrates several security best practices:

✅ **Input Validation**: Adversarial query detection (Part 9)  
✅ **Source Verification**: Whitelist authoritative sources  
✅ **Confidence Scoring**: Refuse low-confidence answers  
✅ **PII Redaction**: Automatic sensitive data filtering  
✅ **Output Validation**: Safety checks for generated content  
✅ **Least Privilege**: Environment-based API key management  
✅ **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers  

## Responsible Use

### Ethical Guidelines
- Use this project for **defensive security only**

- Cite sources when using security information
- Do not violate terms of service of data sources or APIs

### Legal Compliance
- Comply with applicable laws and regulations
- Respect intellectual property rights
- Follow responsible disclosure for vulnerabilities
- Adhere to API provider terms of service
