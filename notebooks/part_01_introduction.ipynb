    "2. **Language Generation**: Using an LLM to generate answers based on retrieved context\n",

    "This solves key LLM limitations:\n",
    "- ❌ **Knowledge cutoff**: LLMs only know information up to their training date\n",
    "- ❌ **Hallucination**: LLMs may confidently generate incorrect information\n",
    "- ❌ **No source attribution**: Can't verify where information comes from\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG provides:\n",
    "- ✅ **Current information**: Query up-to-date knowledge bases\n",
    "- ✅ **Grounded answers**: Responses based on retrieved documents\n",
    "- ✅ **Source citations**: Transparency about information sources\n",
